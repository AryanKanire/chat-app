# Real-Time Chat App

This is a full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to sign up, log in, and communicate with each other in real-time using Socket.io. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, and the authentication is handled using JWT.

## Features
